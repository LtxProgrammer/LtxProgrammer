# Hello!
Greetings reader, I'm @LtxProgrammer. I've been programming since 2015, but only really started using Github in 2022. I know vast amounts of C++, and a good chunk of Java.
I love working with 3D graphics, be it modding a game, or writing a game engine from scratch.

If you want to chat, my discord is @ltxpgm
